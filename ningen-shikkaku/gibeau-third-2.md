## Part Two

Horiki and myself.

To scorn one another, to reduce one another to mediocrity. If this is what is meant by “friendship” then Horiki and I were the epitome of “friends.”

Thanks entirely to the chivalry of the Madam from Kyōbashi (it may sound odd to speak of chivalry in a woman but experience has taught me—at least in the city—that women possess the quality of what I can only call chivalry in far greater quantities than men. Men, as a rule, are cowardly, trembling creatures who care for nothing but appearances and are stingy to boot), I succeeded in making Yoshiko my common-law wife. We rented a small room in eastern Tokyo on the first floor of a tiny two-story apartment in Tsukiji, near the Sumida River. I quit drinking and dedicated myself to what was, it seemed, becoming my chosen path—cartoons. After dinner we went to the movies and on the way home stopped at a coffee shop or bought a flower pot and so on. More than anything, I loved to simply listen to her and to gaze at her, this woman who trusted me to the very core of her being. It was around then that I started to think that I might, just possibly, be turning into something that resembled a human being. I began to feel a faint, warm hope that I might avoid a miserable death after all, when Horiki reappeared at my doorstep.

“Hey pervert! Well, now—what’s this? Could you be turning respectable? I come bearing tidings from the Lady of Kōenji,” he began but suddenly dropped his voice. He gave a jerk of his chin in the direction of Yoshiko in the kitchen, as though to see if it was safe to talk.

“It’s fine. You can say whatever you like,” I replied calmly.

Indeed, I think Yoshiko had a divine gift for trusting people. She never suspected anything about my relationship with the Madam from Kyōbashi, and even when I told her about the Kamakura incident she didn’t believe there had been anything between Tsuneko and me. Not because I was a particularly gifted liar. Sometimes I even made a point of speaking as frankly and candidly as I could, but she just dismissed everything as a joke.

“Well, I can see you’re doing well for yourself—same as always. In any case, it’s nothing important. She just wanted me to tell you to come and visit her sometime.”

Just as I am on the verge of forgetting, that winged monster dives, its beak ripping open the scab of memory. Vivid images of past sins and past shames suddenly unfold before my eyes and I grow so terrified that I want to scream. I can’t sit still.

Me: “Go for a drink?”

Horiki: “Sure.”

Me and Horiki. Cast from the same mold. We are, I sometimes thought, all but indistinguishable from one another. This only held true when we were together drinking cheap liquor; when we went out we transformed into the same dog with the same coat of fur, sniffing around the snowy alleys of the red-light district.

From that day we rekindled our old friendship, we’d go back to the tiny Kyōbashi bar, too and, in the end, we two drunken dogs would find our way back to Shizuko’s apartment in Kōenji, sometimes even spending the night there before heading home in the morning.

I will never forget. It was a hot, muggy summer evening. Sometime around sunset Horiki showed up at our apartment wearing a threadbare yukata. Due to “various circumstances” he’d pawned his summer clothes, but there would be trouble if his mother found out so he needed to redeem them as soon as possible and would I lend him the money? Unfortunately, we didn’t have any money either, so, as was my usual practice, I sent Yoshiko off to pawn some of her clothes and, as the sum she received was slightly more than what Horiki required, I had her buy some shōchū liquor with the rest and we went up to the roof where we bathed in the feeble, muddy breeze that occasionally wafted in from the Sumida River and held a thoroughly squalid summer banquet.

We played a game of my own invention that consisted of categorizing nouns as either “comic” or “tragic.” Just as nouns were divided into masculine, feminine, neutral, and so on, I thought it only proper that they should also be divided into the comic and the tragic. For example, steamer and steam locomotive are both tragic nouns whereas bus and streetcar are comic. Why? If you have to ask then clearly you are not qualified to discuss such weighty matters of art. Just as a playwright who allowed so much as a single tragic noun to find its way into a comedy would be scorned, so too would a tragedy that contained a comic noun.

“Ready? How about tobacco?” I asked.

“Trag (our abbreviation for tragedy),” Horiki said almost before I finished.

“Medicine?”

“Powder or pills?”

“Injections.”

“Trag.”

“Really? It might just be a hormone injection.”

“No, trag. Absolutely trag. Come on, it’s the needles—could anything be more trag?”

“All right, you win. But, you know, medicine and doctors—they’re actually com (our abbreviation for comedy). What about death?”

“Com. Pastors and Buddhist priests, too.”

“Bravo. So, I suppose that life is trag.”

“No, that’s com too.”

“No, if we do that then everything will be com. All right, I’ll try one more, then. Cartoonist. Surely that can’t be com.”

“Tragedy, tragedy. An epic tragedy.”

“What’s that? Surely you’re the epic tragedy.”

There was nothing remarkable about our feeble wordplay but, at the time, it seemed to us a most refined amusement, the likes of which had never graced the finest salons of the world—and we were absurdly proud of it.

Around the same time I’d invented another, similar game where the players had to guess the antonyms for words. The ant (an abbreviation for antonym) for black was white. However, the ant for white was red and the ant for red, black.

“What’s the ant for flower?” I asked.

Horiki frowned slightly as he considered. “Well, there’s a restaurant called ‘Moon and Flowers’ so it must be moon.”

“No, no. That’s not an ant. If it’s anything, it’s a synonym. Among the poets even stars and violets are synonyms, right? Not ants.”

“OK, OK. Then, let’s see . . . bees!”

“Bees?”

“‘Atop the peonies . . . ’ as the poem goes. . . . Or was it an ant?”

“Come now, that’s a motif—you can’t fool me.”

“I’ve got it! ‘Gathering clouds obscure the flowers . . . ’”

“It’s supposed to be ‘Gathering clouds obscure the moon.’”

“Oh yeah, that’s right. A wind scatters the flowers. It’s the wind. The ant of flowers is the wind.”

“I don’t like it. It sounds like something you’d get from a wandering minstrel. Your true colors are starting to show.”

“No, I’ve got it—it’s the loquat. Same shape as your minstrel’s lute.”

“That’s even worse. The ant for flowers . . . What is the one thing in the world that is most unlike flowers? That’s what you need to find . . .”

“In that case . . . hang on. I’ve got it! It’s ‘woman.’”

“And while you’re at it, the synonym for woman is?”

“Tripe.”

“You, it seems, are wholly ignorant of the art of poesy. Give us the ant for tripe, then.”

“Milk.”

“That’s not half bad. One more in that vein, then: shame. What’s the ant?”

“Shameless. The famous cartoonist, Jōshi Ikita.”

“What about Horiki Masao?”

Our laughter gradually began to fade as we succumbed to that mood particular to shōchū, that gloomy drunkenness, where your head feels like it is filled with shards of broken glass.

“Don’t be a smart aleck. At least I’ve never been marched across the city with a rope tied about my waist.”

I froze. It suddenly dawned on me that, all this time, Horiki had never really seen me as having turned over a new leaf. To him I was still nothing more than a shameless, stupid ghost who had even managed to fail at dying, a “living corpse.” When he could use me for his own amusement, he did so. That was the extent of our “friendship.” As you might expect, this realization did nothing to cheer me but, given the circumstances, it was only natural that Horiki should feel this way. Ever since I was a child I’d failed at being human so it was only right that I be scorned, even by the likes of Horiki.

“Crime. What’s the antonym for crime, I wonder? This is a tough one,” I said, feigning bland indifference.

“Law, of course.” His response was so blasé that I looked up, considering him. The flickering red glow of the neon light from a nearby building gave his expression a particularly grim look, and the flinty, pitiless features of a detective. I was utterly taken aback.

“That’s not what crime is, you know. Not at all.”

Law? The antonym of crime! Yet, perhaps that kind of simplistic thinking is typical of people in society. The belief that crime flourishes when there are no detectives around.

“Well what, then? God? You do have the stink of a Christian priest about you, after all. A bit disgusting, really.”

“Now let’s not be so hasty. We should put our heads together for this one. It’s an interesting problem, no? I suspect we might learn all there is to know about a man by the way he answers this question.”

“Don’t be ridiculous. The ant for crime is . . . virtue. A virtuous citizen. That is to say, someone like me.”

“Enough joking. Anyway, virtue is the ant for evil. It’s not the ant for crime.”

“So crime and evil are different, then?”

“Yes. I think so. Virtue and evil are human concepts. They’re moral terms arbitrarily made up by human beings.”

“You never shut up, do you? All right, then, it must be God after all. God, God, God. You can’t go wrong by putting everything on God. Damn, I’m hungry.”

“Yoshiko’s boiling some broad beans for us now.”

“Excellent. Love ’em.”

He lay back, arms crossed behind his head.

“It’s almost as though you don’t care about crime at all.”

“Of course not. I’m not a criminal like you, after all. I like to have a good time and all but I don’t go around getting women killed or stealing their money.”

Deep in my heart an echo, faint and desperate, welled up in protest. I didn’t kill her. I didn’t steal anyone’s money. As usual, however, my resolve soon wavered. It was my fault, after all.

I was incapable of a straightforward argument. The gloom brought on by the shōchū made me more irascible by the minute, and it was all I could do to keep my anger in check. I started muttering, as though talking to myself.

“Just being thrown in jail isn’t a crime. If we can figure out the ant for crime then we can grasp the essence of crime. . . . God? Salvation? Love? Light? But Satan is the ant for God and I suppose that suffering would be the ant for salvation. Hate for love, darkness for light, evil for virtue. Crime and prayer, crime and regret, crime and confession, crime and . . . Ah, I give up. They’re all synonyms. What is the ant for crime?”

“The opposite of crime is revenge. Sweet like revenge. I’m starving here. Go get me something to eat.”

“Go get it yourself!” For what may very well have been the first time in my life, I roared in anger.

“Fine. I’ll just wander downstairs and commit some crimes with Yoshi-chan. A hands-on experiment will reveal more than any amount of debate. The ant of crime is sweet beans. No, broad beans.”

He was so drunk by then he could barely speak without slurring.

“Do what you like. Just get the hell out of here!”

“Crime and hunger, hunger and beans—no, they’re synonyms,” he continued to mutter nonsense as he clambered to his feet.

Crime and punishment. Dostoevsky. This thought grazed the edge of my consciousness and I gasped with sudden realization. What if we looked at Mr. Dost’s Crime and Punishment not as synonyms, but reconfigured them as antonyms? Crime and punishment . . . Utterly at odds with one another, chalk and cheese. Dost’s crime and punishment as ants . . . Dost’s fetid swamp, a pond teeming with algae, the very depths of chaos . . . Ah, I was on the verge of realization but no, still . . . It was then, just as these thoughts were racing through my head like the shadows of a spinning lantern . . .

“Hey! Terrible beans! Get down here!” Horiki was standing over me. His voice sounded strange, his pallor off. He’d just stumbled off downstairs but he was back already.

“What’s wrong?”

There was a strange tension in the air as we went down the stairs to the second floor. Halfway down the next flight of stairs Horiki stopped.

“Look!” He whispered urgently, pointing.

The small window above my room was open and we could see inside. The light was on, two animals were inside.

I felt dizzy, my vision blurred. It’s just what human beings do, that’s all. No cause for surprise, I whispered to myself, gasping for breath. I stood rooted to the spot, forgetting even to go to Yoshiko’s aid.

Horiki cleared his throat loudly. I fled, springing up the stairs to the roof where I threw myself down, face to the drizzling summer night. What I felt then was not rage, hatred, or even sadness but rather an overpowering terror. It was not the terror of a ghost in a graveyard. It was the terror of encountering a spirit, clad all in white, amid the towering cedars of a Shintō shrine. A ferocious, ancient terror that robbed me of speech. My hair began to turn gray that night. I lost confidence in everything. I was suspicious of everyone. I was forever alienated from all notions of hope, sympathy, or joy in the workings of the world. This was truly a decisive moment in my life. It was as though my head had been split open and, from that moment on, any interaction whatsoever with human beings caused that wound to throb.

“I feel bad for you but maybe now you’ll know better. I’m not coming back here. This place . . . It’s hell. But you should forgive Yoshi-chan. You’re no prize yourself, after all. Well, I’m off.”

Horiki was no fool. He wasn’t one to linger when things grew awkward.

I sat up, drank the shōchū, crying bitterly. I thought I could go on weeping forever.

At some point Yoshiko had come up to the roof. She stood behind me, holding a dish heaped with broad beans, a vacant expression on her face.

“He said . . . he wouldn’t do anything. . . .”

“No. Don’t say anything. It’s never occurred to you to doubt people. Sit down. Have some beans.”

We sat next to one another, eating beans. Could it be that trust is a crime? He was a shopkeeper, a small, stupid man of about thirty who commissioned cartoons from me, always making a great show of reluctance when it came to paying me the few coins that were my fee.

The shopkeeper didn’t dare come around again after that, but, for some reason, I found I hated Horiki even more than the shopkeeper. Horiki, who’d discovered them at it but, rather than coughing or clearing his throat to interrupt them, just left and came back up to the roof to tell me. On sleepless nights this hatred and rage had me writhing and groaning in my bed.

It was not a question of forgiving or not forgiving. Yoshiko had a gift for trusting people. She didn’t know to be suspicious of them. Therein lies the tragedy.

I ask you, God. Is trust a crime?

It wasn’t that Yoshiko had been defiled but that her trust had been violated. This caused me such unbearable pain I thought I couldn’t go on living. For someone like me, mean and trembling, forever humoring those around him, whose ability to trust had already been irrevocably shattered, Yoshiko’s pure and innocent trust was as clean and refreshing as a waterfall deep in the woods. In one night it had turned to filthy, yellow sewage. Do you see? Ever since that night Yoshiko trembled before even my slightest smile or frown.

If I called out to her she gave a start and looked around nervously. No matter how hard I tried to make her laugh, no matter how much I played the clown she always seemed to be quivering with fright. She started talking to me with excessive politeness.

Is innocent trust, in the end, the root of all crime?

I read every story I could find featuring wives who were violated. Yet, not one of them had been so cruelly violated as Yoshiko. There was nothing, not the slightest element of fiction about it. My suffering might have been eased somewhat had there been anything even faintly resembling love between Yoshiko and the shopkeeper, but, in the end, it came down to one summer night when Yoshiko trusted someone and that was all there was to it. And so my head seemed to shatter, my voice grew hoarse, my hair turned gray before its time, and Yoshiko trembled in fear the rest of her life. Most of the stories I read focused on whether or not the husband would forgive his wife’s “deeds,” but that wasn’t such a terribly important point for me. Happy indeed, I thought, is the husband who has the right to decide whether or not to forgive. If he deems the offense unforgivable there’s no need for a fuss, he simply divorces her out of hand and finds a new wife. Or, if he can’t do that, he “forgives” her and endures. In either case, everything is arranged to suit the husband’s feelings. That is, while it no doubt comes as quite a shock to the husband, in the end it is for all that nothing more than a “shock”—not something one returns to over and over again, endlessly, like the pounding of waves on the shore. It is, I thought, the kind of problem that, one way or the other, could be resolved by a husband’s righteous anger. Yet, in my case, I possessed none of the rights of the husband, and the more I considered it, the more it seemed to me that everything was my fault. Far from being angry with her, I dared not utter the slightest word of reproach. Indeed, it was because she possessed such rare virtue that she had been violated. It was that virtue, that pure and innocent trust, long admired, that her husband had found so unutterably endearing.

Is innocent trust a crime?

Even that sole, saving virtue was now clouded with suspicion. Nothing made sense to me anymore. My only refuge was alcohol. I drank shōchū from the moment I got up, my features coarsened beyond recognition, several teeth fell out, my cartoons devolved into little more than pornography. No, I’ll be honest. I’d started copying erotic prints and selling them in secret. I needed the money for shōchū. Whenever I looked at Yoshiko, trembling and too frightened to meet my gaze, I recalled how completely trusting she’d once been, and I couldn’t help wondering if that little shopkeeper had been the only one. Maybe Horiki? Or maybe a complete stranger? Suspicion gave rise to suspicion, yet, still, I lacked the courage to come out and ask her directly. So I got drunk on shōchū, and, writhing in my usual terror and anxiety, I made timorous attempts at confronting her, plying her with contemptible leading questions. Like a fool, I alternated between joy and sorrow even as, on the surface, I continued to play the clown to the hilt. I subjected her to despicable, torturous, loving caresses, and then passed out, dead drunk.

Toward the end of that year I came home late one night, stinking drunk. I wanted a glass of sugar water but Yoshiko was already asleep, so I went to the kitchen and dug around for the sugar jar, but when I opened it I discovered that instead of sugar there was only a small, slender black box. I picked it up absently and was astonished when I saw the writing on the box. Most of the letters had been scratched off, probably with someone’s fingernail, but the English writing remained. “DIAL.”

Dial. I was drinking so much shōchū those days I’d stopped using sleeping pills, but, as I’d always been plagued with insomnia, I was familiar with most of the brands. And in that single box of Dial was certainly more than enough for a fatal dose. The seal was intact but she must’ve tried to erase the letters and then hid the box in the sugar jar because, some day, she’d want it and it would be there. Poor girl, unable to read the Roman alphabet, she’d only scratched part of the English writing off before deciding it was enough. (You have committed no crime.)

Careful not to make a sound, I filled a glass with water and, slowly breaking the seal on the box, I tipped its contents into my mouth and calmly drank the glass of water down in one go before turning out the lights and going to bed.

I slept like the dead for three days and nights. The doctor put it down as an accidental overdose so they were able to hold off reporting it to the police. Apparently the first thing I said upon regaining consciousness was that I wanted to go home. Where, precisely, I meant by “home” wasn’t clear even to me, but they told me I broke down in tears after I said it.

The fog gradually lifted, and, opening my eyes, I saw Flounder, looking disgruntled, sitting by my pillow.

“Last time it was the end of the year too, you know. It’s always the end of the year with him. The one time we’re busiest, running around like mad. It’s our health he’s putting at risk with stunts like this.”

He was talking to the Madam of the Kyōbashi bar.

“Madam?” I called out.

“Yes? What is it? Are you awake?” She looked down at me, her smiling face seeming almost to cover my own.

Tears streamed down my cheeks.

“Let me divorce Yoshiko.” The words were out before I realized what I was saying.

I heard a faint sigh as she straightened.

It was then that I let slip something so truly outlandish, something so comical and so idiotic it defies description.

“I, I want to go someplace where there aren’t any women.”

Flounder reacted first, roaring with laughter. Madam began to giggle, and soon I too flushed and grinned wryly, tears still running down my cheeks.

“Yes indeed, a fine idea,” Flounder said. His coarse laughter seemed to go on forever. “You should go someplace where there aren’t any women. You fall to pieces when there are women around. No women—that’s a fine idea.”

Someplace without women. This silly, flippant wish would later be realized in the most dismal manner imaginable.

Yoshiko had somehow convinced herself that, in taking the pills, I’d been sacrificing myself for her, that I’d been taking her place. As a result she became even more timid, never smiling at anything I said, hardly speaking at all. It was too depressing at home, so I was forever going out, drowning myself in cheap liquor again. Ever since the Dial incident, though, I’d gone as thin as a rail. My arms and legs felt heavy and I fell behind in my cartoon work. Flounder left me some money when he came to see me at the hospital (he’d called it a “small gift from Shibuta” when he handed it over, acting for all the world as if it were coming out of his own pocket, but it seems that it too was from my brothers. Unlike when I ran away from his house, I saw through Flounder’s play-acting now—if only vaguely—and when he started putting on airs I played my part too, pretending not to suspect a thing, muttering my meek thanks. There were times I almost understood why Flounder insisted on these convoluted deceptions and times I did not. It was all very strange to me), so I spontaneously decided to use it for a solitary tour of the hot springs in southern Izu. But I was unsuited for a leisurely trip to the spas. I grew inconsolable when I thought of Yoshiko, and the reflective state of mind you need to contemplate mountain landscapes eluded me entirely. I didn’t bother changing into the quilted jacket provided by the inn, nor did I bother with the baths. Instead I rushed outside and, bursting into a grimy coffee shop, bathed myself in shōchū instead. By the time I went back to Tokyo, I was in even worse shape than when I’d left.

It had snowed heavily in Tokyo. I was stumbling about, drunk, in one of the back alleys of Ginza, quietly singing the refrain, “How many hundreds of leagues from home,” over and over again, kicking the tips of my shoes at the snow that had accumulated when I suddenly vomited. That was the first time I’d ever vomited blood. I’d made a giant rising sun flag in the snow. For a while I just squatted there, scooping up clean snow in both hands and washing my face with it as I wept.

Whaaat narrow alley is thiiis?

Whaaat narrow alley is thiiis?

The forlorn voice of a young girl singing the nursery rhyme seemed to drift out from the darkness, so faint I thought my ears might be playing tricks on me. Misery. The world had all sorts of miserable people—I doubt it would be much of an exaggeration to say it was filled with miserable people. Yet their misery was of the sort where they could unabashedly protest their misery to “society.” “Society,” in turn, immediately understood their protest and was sympathetic to it. My misery, on the other hand, was entirely the product of my own guilt, so there was nobody I could turn to. Should I venture even the most tentative of objections it wouldn’t just be Flounder sneering at me, despairing at my nerve, but all of society as a whole. Was it simply that I, as the saying goes, thought “the whole world revolves around me”? Or was it the opposite? Was I too timid? I myself had no idea. I was nothing more than a lump of guilt, capable only of making myself ever more miserable, with absolutely no idea how to stop.

I stood up and my first thought was to get some sort of medicine, so I went to the nearest pharmacy. My gaze met that of the lady of the shop. Instantly. She lifted her head, eyes widening as though bathed in a flash of light, standing rooted to the spot. Yet her eyes widened not in loathing or fear but rather in pleading, as though yearning for salvation. Ah, she is miserable too. I’m certain of it. Those who suffer misery can sense it in others. Just as this thought crossed my mind I saw her totter as she leaned heavily on a pair of crutches. I had to suppress my sudden urge to rush to her side. Tears spilled from my eyes as I gazed at her. Her large eyes began to overflow with tears as well.

That’s all. Without a single word, I turned and left, stumbling back to my apartment. I had Yoshiko make me a glass of salt water and, drinking it down, went to bed without a word. The next morning I lied and said that I felt a cold coming on so I could spend the day in bed. By the time night fell, I had grown so anxious I could endure it no longer and I went back to the pharmacy, this time smiling as I explained my condition in detail and asked the woman for advice.

“You have to stop drinking.”

She spoke familiarly, as though we were relatives.

“But I think I might be an alcoholic. Even now I want a drink.”

“You mustn’t. My husband got TB and drowned himself in liquor. Said it’d kill off the bacteria but it ended up killing him instead.”

“I’m too frightened, I can’t. I’m too scared.”

“I’ll give you some medicine. But you must stop drinking no matter what.”

The woman (a widow with a son who’d gone to medical school in Chiba or someplace like that but, as soon as he got accepted he came down with the same illness that killed his father and now he was on leave, convalescing in hospital. She had a bedridden father-in-law at home and one of her legs had been useless ever since she came down with polio when she was five) stumped around the shop on her crutches taking things from this shelf and that drawer as she gathered up various medicines for me.

This one will replenish your blood.

These are vitamin injections. The syringe is here.

These are calcium supplements. Diastase to settle your stomach.

This one for this, that one for that—she went on, lovingly explaining five or six different kinds of medicines, but, in the end, even this miserable woman’s love was too much for me. Finally, she said, deftly wrapping a small box, this is for when you can’t take it anymore and absolutely must have a drink.

It was morphine.

She said it wouldn’t be as bad as liquor, and I believed her. What’s more, it had gotten to the point where even I had come to think there was something unclean about the way I drank. For the first time in a very long time I felt a sense of joy at the prospect of being able to escape from the Satan of liquor. So without any hesitation I promptly injected the morphine into my arm. Instantly, all my anxiety, irascibility, and timidity melted clean away. I was garrulous, cheerful. One shot of morphine and even my worries about my declining health vanished. I poured myself into my cartoons, coming up with ideas so odd and so amusing that I burst out laughing even as I drew.

I meant to limit myself to one injection a day but before long one became two and by the time two became four I couldn’t work without it.

“You have to stop. If you get addicted . . . Well, that would be terrible.”

When the woman said that I figured that I must already be well and truly addicted (I was extremely susceptible to the suggestions of others. Somehow I’d managed to convince myself of the odd notion that I was obliged to disappoint people. If someone handed me money and said, “You really shouldn’t spend it but, being you, you’ll probably spend it anyway,” I felt that I had to spend the money, that it was my duty to disappoint them, and I would rush right out and spend every last coin), but the idea that I might be addicted only made me more anxious and this, in turn, caused me to crave the drug all the more.

“Please, I’m begging you. Just one more box. I’ll pay what I owe you at the end of the month, I promise.”

“It’s not the bill that concerns me, you can pay that whenever you like. It’s the police I’m worried about.”

Ah, it seems I am doomed forever to have a cunning, gloomy, shadowy aura trailing about after me.

“You’ll find a way to get around them. I’m begging you. Shall I give you a kiss?”

She blushed, and I saw my opening.

“Look, without the medicine I can’t get any work done at all. It’s like a stimulant.”

“In that case you’d do better with a hormone injection.”

“Don’t make fun of me. If I can’t drink then it’s got to be the medicine. I can’t work without either of them.”

“But you mustn’t drink.”

“Right? And ever since I started taking the medicine I haven’t touched a drop. Thanks to you I’m feeling much better. I’m not going to spend my whole life drawing lousy cartoons, you know. I’ll stop drinking, get my health back, work hard, and one day I’ll become a famous painter, you’ll see. This is a critical time for me. Please, I’m begging you. Here, I’ll give you a kiss.”

At that the woman burst out laughing. “You’re hopeless, you know that? Don’t blame me if get addicted though.”

She thumped across the floor with her crutches and took the drug from a shelf.

“I can’t give you the whole box. You’ll go through it in no time. You can have half.”

“Stingy, aren’t you? Still, it’s better than nothing, I suppose.”

I injected an ampule as soon as I got home.

“Doesn’t it hurt?” Yoshiko asked timidly.

“’Course it hurts. But I’ve got no choice. If I’m going to get through all this work, I’ve got to do it, whether I like it or not. I’m a lot better these days, right? Now I’ve got work to do. Work, work, work.” I chattered away cheerfully.

Once I even showed up in the dead of night, pounding on the shop door. When she came tottering out on crutches, still in her nightclothes, I grabbed her, kissing her, and pretending to cry.

Wordlessly, she handed me a box.

By the time I realized that the drug was just as vile as shōchū—no, even worse—I was a full-blown addict. I had truly reached the depths of degradation. Desperate for the drug, I’d started copying erotic prints again, and it wasn’t long before the crippled woman and I began, quite literally, an ugly affair.

I want to die. Now more than ever, I want to die. There is no going back. There is nothing I can do. Nothing can help. I can only add more layers of shame. Dreams of bicycle rides and forest waterfalls are not for me. My lot is to lay one filthy, contemptible crime atop another, to suffer ever more violent anguish. I want to die. I have to die. Life itself is the root of all crime.

Near mad and consumed with these thoughts, I nevertheless continued to spend each day running back and forth between my room and the pharmacy.

The more I worked, the more I needed the drug, and before long I’d accumulated a terrifying debt. Whenever the lady from the pharmacy saw me tears welled up in her eyes even as they trickled down my cheeks.

Hell.

This was my last chance to escape from hell. If it fails, I thought, there is nothing left for me but a noose around my neck. Thus resolved, as though wagering everything on the existence of God, I wrote a long letter to Father. In it I confessed everything (except for the woman. Even I couldn’t bring myself to write about that) about my current state.

The outcome was even worse than I had imagined. Days passed one after another yet no reply came. I grew restless and anxious and this, in turn, made me take even more of the drug.

Tonight, I secretly resolved, tonight I’ll inject ten ampules and jump in the river. That very afternoon, as though possessed of the devil’s own intuition, Flounder showed up, Horiki tagging along behind him.

“I hear you’ve been coughing up blood?”

Horiki sat cross-legged in front of me. So kind and gentle was his smile that I thought I’d never seen its like before. I was overwhelmed with gratitude and so overjoyed by his kindly smile I had to turn away lest they see the tears streaming down my cheeks. That one, gentle smile utterly destroyed me. I was buried alive.

I was put in a car. The most important thing is to get you to a hospital. We’ll take care of everything else, Flounder urged quietly (so gentle were his words I could almost describe them as compassionate), and, as though all will and judgment of my own had vanished, I wept softly as I obeyed every command, the very soul of meekness. Yoshiko climbed in the car too, and the four of us jostled and swayed as we drove for what seemed a very long time. Just as the sky began to darken the car stopped at the entrance to a large hospital deep in a forest.

A sanatorium. I was certain of it.

A young doctor subjected me to a disconcertingly courteous, tender examination.

“Well, I think you should rest here for a little while,” he said with an almost shy smile. Flounder, Horiki, and Yoshiko were to return home, leaving me there all on my own. As they turned to go, Yoshiko handed me a cloth bundle containing a change of clothes and then, wordlessly, held out the syringe and remaining ampules of morphine. It seems she really had believed me when I said it was just a stimulant.

“No, I don’t need it anymore.”

This was truly remarkable. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this solitary instance was the only time in my entire life I rejected something offered me. Mine was the misery of one who cannot say no. I was terrified that, should I refuse, an irreparable, eternal crack would snake through the both of us. Yet, at that instant, though half-mad with cravings, I refused the morphine without a second thought. Perhaps I’d been moved by Yoshiko’s “divine ignorance.” I wonder if my addiction did not cease at that precise moment.

After that the young doctor with the shy smile showed me to one wing of the hospital, and then I heard the lock clang shut. I was in a lunatic asylum.

I want to go someplace where there aren’t any women. That careless remark, uttered after the Dial incident, had been, it seems, realized in the most peculiar manner. My wing of the hospital held only men who were insane. Even the nurses were men. Not a single woman to be seen.

I was no longer a mere criminal. I was mad. But no, I certainly wasn’t insane or anything like it. I’d never, not for a moment, gone mad. Ah, but I suppose that’s the sort of thing a lunatic would say. I suppose that if they put you in this hospital it means you’re crazy, and if they don’t, it means you’re normal.

I ask you, God. Is it a crime not to resist?

I was moved to tears by Horiki’s strangely beautiful smile, I abandoned all judgment and resistance, I got in the car, I was brought here, I became a lunatic. Even were I to leave right now, I would still be branded a lunatic. No. Not a lunatic. A cripple.

A human, failed.

I had, utterly and completely, ceased to be human.

When I arrived it was early summer, and, peering through the bars of my window, I could see the red blossoms of lilies floating atop the small pond in the hospital garden. Three months later the cosmos were starting to bloom, and, my eldest brother, with Flounder in tow, appeared out of the blue to get me out. Father had died of a gastric ulcer at the end of last month. We don’t care about your past. We don’t want you to worry about money. You don’t have to do anything. In exchange, you have to leave everything, get out of Tokyo right away, and go to the countryside to recover. We know you still have unfinished business in Tokyo but Shibuta has already taken care of most of the loose ends so you don’t need to worry about it. My brother spoke in his characteristically tense, somber manner.

I could almost see the mountains and rivers of my hometown floating before my eyes. I gave a weak nod.

Truly, a cripple.

My last pillar crumbled when I heard that Father was dead. He was no more. That presence, comforting and terrifying, had always been with me. Gone. It was as though the vessel of anguish had run dry. I even wondered if it was because of Father that this vessel had weighed so heavily upon me. All motivation fled me. I’d lost even the ability to suffer.

My brother was true to his word and did all that he promised. Four or five hours south of my hometown by train there is a hot springs region near the sea that is unusually warm for northeast Japan. He bought me a house on the outskirts of a small village there. It had five rooms, crumbling walls, and pillars chewed away by insects. It was so dilapidated as to be almost beyond repair. He also provided me with a servant, an ugly woman of almost sixty years with horrible rust-colored hair.

I’ve been here a little more than three years now and have been subjected to any number of odd violations by that old servant, Tetsu. Sometimes we argue like an old married couple. Sometimes my lung disease worsens, sometimes it improves. I grow thinner and I grow fatter. Sometimes I cough up blood. Yesterday I sent Tetsu to the pharmacy to buy me a box of Carmotine, my usual sedative. The box she brought back was different from the usual one, but I didn’t take particular note of it. Though I took ten tablets before going to bed I still didn’t feel at all sleepy. Just as I started to wonder at this, my stomach suddenly started rumbling, and, rushing to the toilet, I suffered a terrible attack of diarrhea. I had to run to the toilet three more times that night. Growing suspicious, I looked at the box more carefully and saw that it was actually Crapotine, a laxative.

I lay flat on my back in bed, a hot water bottle atop my stomach, thinking about what I would say to Tetsu.

“Look here, this isn’t Carmotine at all—it’s Crapotine!” But before I could go any further, I started to giggle. I guess, in the end, “cripple” is a comic noun. The cripple tries to sleep but takes a laxative instead. To top it off, the laxative is called “Crapotine.”

I am beyond joy or misery now.

All things pass.

That is the only truth I have encountered in all the days I’ve spent in this cold hell of a world of so-called “humans.”

All things pass.

I will be twenty-seven years old this year. My hair has turned gray and most people would say I look over forty.
